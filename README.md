# Work in Progress

## Working
1. **Navigation**: Functional for folders, notes, and to-dos.
2. **Menu Bar**: Allows creating new notes, folders, and to-dos.
3. **"..." Button**: Navigates back a folder.

## In Progress
1. **Menus for Folders**: Menu pops up but doesn’t work yet; still deciding on the items to list.
2. **Menus for Notes/To-dos**: Menu pops up but doesn’t work yet; still deciding on the items to list.
3. **Menu Link**: Currently non-functional.
4. **Folder Name Header**: No functionality yet.
5. **Bottom Buttons**:
   - Sync
   - New Folder
   - New Note
   - New To-do
   - Recycle Bin

## To Do
- Implement drag-and-drop for folders.
- Add "Sort by" menu.

## Issues
1. **Sync Issue**: Syncing moves the navigation panel to another folder; unsure if fixable.
2. **Note Selection Issue**: Selecting a note in "All Notes" moves you to a folder instead of staying in "All Notes" and displaying the "in:" link.
